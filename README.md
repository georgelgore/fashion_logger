# Fashion Logger

An app built to store all of your favorite fashions! Create topics like: "Streetwear" or "Prada F/W 2017" and upload images to that topic. Fashion Logger allows the fashion minded to store their favorite inspo in whatever mode they would like.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone down the project. For the backend files, run 'bundle install' 'rails:db migrate' and 'rails db:seed'. For the front, run 'npm install' and 'npm start'.

## Motivation 

Fashion Logger is my take on Pinterest... for fashion. The idea for this product was that lovers of fashion could store all of their favorite images by topic, whether it be color, mood, runway, or designer! This app was built with a Rails backend and React on the frontend. Design elements were done using custom CSS as well as Semantic UI.

### Prerequisites

The app is preloaded with the required gems and npm files. As long as you have rails and react installed on the machine, this will run with no problems.
